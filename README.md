# Sticky-Notes

Project done with JavaScript. It is a typical application of reminders filled in sticky notes. You can create as many notes as you want, edit them and dispose of them whenever you want, they will never be erased!

## Getting Started
To create a note you simply have to fill in the form data and give it to create to have the reminder on screen with the creation date.
If you have made a mistake you can modify it, click anywhere in the note and modify it with the form that will appear on screen, when you press the button it will disappear and your note will be updated.
